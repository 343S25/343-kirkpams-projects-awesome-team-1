    <h2>Professional Practices</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>VS Code formats my code by default.</li>
        <li>Code is organized into images, styles, scripts, and design (see script links)</li>
        <li>Aesthetic is simple for the purpose of being unassuming and unintimidating for users that are first starting
            budgeting.</li>
        <li>Style is coherent across pages. Style rules are determined by Bootstrap classes.</li>
        <li>Content is neatly aligned.</li>
        <li>Content has sufficient and consistent spacing.</li>
        <li>Source code is readable and uses meaningful names for classes/IDs, and standard naming convention for
            identifiers.</li>
        <li>Source code uses alt and ARIA features appropriately.</li>
        <li>File names are entirely lowercase and only alphanumeric characters.</li>
        <li>Comments are meaningful and helpful for understanding.</li>

    </ol>
