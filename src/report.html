    <h1>Report for Milestone 2</h1>
    <h2>Preface: To see some of the features, you will have to go to the home page and add an account. From there, you
        can click on the account name to go to the account page. On the account page you can add a transaction or a
        stock. The stock is where the API is used. Add transaction functions and displays new transactions on the home
        page.</h2>
    <h2>Overall Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You must use the git repository your professor created for the project.<ul>
                <li>Done.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You must publish the site to the <code>w3.cs.jmu.edu</code> server.<ul>
                <li>Done. Find at <a
                        href="https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/makelajr/cs343/project/help.html">https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/makelajr/cs343/project/help.html</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. Use comments to
            note where you completed this requirement.<ul>
                <li>My site uses Bootstrap breakpoints small (&geq;576px) and large (&geq;992px) Though changes
                    are
                    minor, they are there. For example, on screens between 576 and 991 pixels, the "At a Glance" section
                    on index.html moves form the side to the top. As I add more features, I will create more responsive
                    designs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. The main page must be
            named <code>index.html</code>. Your pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful way.
            <ul>
                <li>Though there is only 3 base pages, each serve distinct purposes and some take on multiple roles. For
                    example, the account page will allow you to manage transactions and balances. There are also modals
                    for forms.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your site must include some sort of header.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Done.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.
            <ul>
                <li>Done. The header includes nav links to the home page and help page.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your site must include images, and their <code>alt</code> attributes must adequately describe the image
            content to users of screen readers, users with images disabled, and web crawlers.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An image is present on the help page with alt text. More images may be added after this milestone,
                    but there is
                    really no need for images. I could possibly add them as icons.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the <a
                href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">Nu HTML Checker</a> and <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE
                Accessibility</a> evaluator.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Tested and validated.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. For example, headings are often rendered in a
            sans-serif font, and paragraphs in a serif font.</li>
        <li>Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point, but it must be
            present. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.
            <ul>
                <li>Forms are found in multiple different modals after pressing "Add Account", or when in an account on
                    an account.html, "Add Transaction" or "Add Stock"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your site must include links to external sites.
            <ul>
                <li>Satisfied on help page. Seems unncessary though.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You site must make at least two network requests (using <code>fetch()</code>) to an external API. The
            resulting data must be processed and rendered in a meaningful way.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Add Stock button calls a function that fetches stcok data from the Alpha Vantage API. Right now,
                    it is just being logged in the console (Dr. Stewart you said it was ok to do this), but will be used
                    later to calculate total value of an account. This can be "done" twice for two separate stocks.
                    Hopefully this is enough. If not, I am already planning to add a search bar for ticker symbols in
                    our next milestone.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Professional Practices</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Your source code must be formatted using a consistent standard. We recommend using the built-in support in
            VS Code for formatting HTML and CSS (other options like <em>Prettier</em> may not default to producing valid
            HTML).
            <ul>
                <li>I used VS Code auto formatter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your site's non-HTML resources must be organized:<ul>
                <li>Images should be placed in a directory named <code>images</code>.</li>
                <li>CSS files should be placed in a directory named <code>styles</code>.</li>
                <li>JS files should be placed in a directory named <code>scripts</code>.</li>
                <li>Design sketch files should in a directory named <code>design</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Done. Check source.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your interface must demonstrate good aesthetics, including good choices for color schemes, layout (using
            grids and/or flexboxes, along with non-static positions), and dynamic effects.
            <ul>
                <li>The site is simple yes, but it is consistent with Bootstrap colors and has an intuitive design.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared
            external stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate external stylesheets.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dealt with using Bootstrap and a shared style sheet for the header.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and
            right-alignment over centeringâ€”as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.
            <ul>
                <li>Done.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The content should have adequate and consistent spacing. Text should not overflow the surrounding box.
            <ul>
                <li>Done.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for
            classes and IDs. Use kebab-case (preferred) or camelCase identifiers.<ul>
                <li>My formatter keeps me honest. I used camelCase.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your source code should use semantic and structural elements to support accessible usage. You should also
            use ARIA features as appropriate. In particular, you must adhere to the Level A recommendations in the <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/">WCAG Checklist</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>Done.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.
            <ul>
                <li>Done.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You should write meaningful comments.
            <ul>
                <li>Done. Using JSDoc formats for functions, and interspersed comments in HTML and JS functions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
